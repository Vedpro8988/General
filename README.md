# Barbie's Bungee Jump Calculator 🪂💕

A physics-based bungee jump safety calculator built for educational purposes.

## 📚 About This Project

This is a student assignment project that calculates safe bungee jumping parameters using energy conservation principles. The calculator takes inputs like jumper mass, height, and starting position to determine the optimal rope configuration for a safe jump.

This calculator is for educational demonstration only and should NOT be used for actual bungee jumping operations. Professional equipment, training, and supervision are required for real bungee jumping activities.

## 🎯 Features

- User-friendly interface with playful design
- Physics-based calculations using energy conservation
- Real-time computation of:
  - String added length
  - Bungee cord stretch distance
  - Energy analysis (gravitational and elastic potential energy)
  - Safety parameters

## 🔬 Physics Model

The calculator uses the following physics principles:
- **Energy Conservation**: Total Energy = Gravitational PE + Elastic PE
- **Spring Mechanics**: Elastic PE = ½kx²
- **Safety Margins**: Buffer zones and no-go zones

### Given Constants:
- Spring Constant (k): 4.5 N/m
- Buffer: 0.2 m
- No-Go Zone: 0.1 m
- Ending Height: 0.3 m
- Gravity: 9.8 m/s²

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Enter the mass of the jumper (kg)
2. Enter the starting height (m)
3. Enter the height of the jumper (m)
4. Enter the unstretched string length (m)
5. Click "Calculate Magic" to see results!
